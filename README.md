Travel Tour System - Project skeleton
------------------------------------
This skeleton contains JSP views, Java model/dao/service/controller stubs,
web.xml and pom.xml so you can import into IntelliJ as a Maven webapp.

Tips:
- Import as Maven project in IntelliJ.
- Configure a Tomcat/Jetty run configuration to deploy the WAR.
- Update DatabaseConnection.java with your DB credentials.
